`anndata` is for simple (functional) high-level APIs for data analysis
pipelines. In this context, it provides an efficient, scalable way of keeping
track of data together with learned annotations and reduces the code overhead
typically encountered when using a mostly object-oriented library such as
`scikit-learn`.

The prime use is currently for `Scanpy <https://github.com/theislab/scanpy>`_,
for which `anndata` was initially developed. Both packages have been introduced
in `Genome Biology (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1382-0>`_.
